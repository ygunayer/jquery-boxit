jquery-boxit
============

Yet another jQuery slider plugin. First attempt at a full fledged jQuery plugin, also at github hosted development.

Initial commit is really primitive and dirty, so here's a short TODO list.

TODO
====
- Use proper closures!
- Add a loading indicator
- Parameterize tile transition effects
- Allow custom animation handlers
- Remove jQuery library from the repo, use CDN instead
- Remove images from the repo, use CDN instead
